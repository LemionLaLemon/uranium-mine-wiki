![Map of the Actinium Mine from a top-down view (lighter = higher elevation, darker = lower elevation)](/images/locations/actiniumminemap.png)

The Actinium Mine was added in version [294 pre-alpha](/#version-294). It was the first mine ever added to **Uranium Mine Simulator** intended just to test the spawning and mining mechanics, but was cromulent enough to have stayed around until now. The Actinium Mine contains 2 NPCs, Dyatlov and Ivan, and a handful of spawn nodes that spawn `Q1Actinium`, `Q2Actinium`, and `Q3Actinium`

!!!Info
The tool forms of the Actinium are called `ActiniumT1`, `ActiniumT2`, and `ActiniumT3` while the mineable model forms are called `Q1Actinium`, `Q2Actinium`, and `Q3Actinium`.
